            <h1>Employee Attrition Rate Data Analysis</h1>
            <p>An analysis of employee attrition rates using data science techniques and Python.</p>
        </header>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Solution Summary</h2>
            <p>The organization was facing high employee attrition rates, leading to increased recruitment costs and loss of experienced staff. To address this issue, a machine learning application was developed to predict which employees were most likely to leave. The application analyzed employee data to identify patterns contributing to turnover, allowing HR to implement retention strategies and reduce attrition rates.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Data Summary</h2>
            <p>The application provided a predictive analysis tool that used historical employee data to forecast potential attrition. By identifying at-risk employees, HR professionals could proactively engage in retention efforts or offer career development opportunities, reducing turnover and optimizing workforce planning.</p>
            <h3>Source of Raw Data</h3>
            <p>The raw data was sourced from the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, which includes employee attributes such as demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and performance metrics.</p>
            <h3>Data Processing and Management</h3>
            <p>The data was cleaned to remove missing values and inconsistencies. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the data's structure and identify key variables. Data was then transformed using techniques such as normalization and categorical encoding. Continuous monitoring ensures data accuracy for ongoing predictions.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
            <h3>What:</h3>
            <p>The Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its robustness in handling complex data and its ability to reduce errors due to overfitting.</p>
            <h3>How:</h3>
            <p>The model was trained using a balanced dataset to ensure fair representation. Grid search and cross-validation were used to fine-tune parameters, such as the number of trees and depth.</p>
            <h3>Why:</h3>
            <p>The Random Forest algorithm was selected for its effectiveness in predicting attrition and highlighting key factors influencing it.</p>
            <h3>Additional Models:</h3>
            <p>Logistic regression and gradient boosting models were explored, but Random Forest provided the best combination of clarity and performance.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Validation</h2>
            <p>To validate the model, a separate dataset and several validation techniques were used. The primary metric was the AUC-ROC score, which reached 0.85, indicating strong predictive power. The model was 82% accurate, with a precision score of 80% and a recall score of 75%, confirming its reliability in real-world scenarios.</p>
